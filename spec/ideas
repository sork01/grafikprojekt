base features
    multithreading [fairly easy]
    
    loading of models in wavefront .obj format [done, more or less]
    
    fast wireframe view for positioning before rendering [use lab 3]
    
    non-triangle based primitives
        spheres [easy to raytrace, trickier to wireframe?]
    
    surface materials
        phong shading [fairly easy? interpolate vertex normals over triangles AND the phong reflection model]
        texturing [easy]
        opacity [fairly easy? return my color * my opacity + ray pass through hit object behind * (1.0 - my opacity)]
        specular (reflective) [fairly easy]
        refraction [fairly easy]
    
    area lights / soft shadows [moderate]

bonus features
    antialiasing [fairly easy]
    
    fast flat shaded view for positioning before rendering [use lab 3]
    
    normal maps [easy]
    
    more non-triangle based primitives?
